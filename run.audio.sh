# This part does feature extraction, it may take quite a while if you have a lot of videos. Totally 3 steps are taken:
# 1. ffmpeg extracts the audio track from each video file into a wav file
# 2. The wav file may contain 2 channels. We always extract the 1st channel using ch_wave
# 3. SMILExtract generates the MFCC features for each wav file
#    The config file MFCC12_0_D_A.conf generates 13-dim MFCCs at each frame, together with the 1st and 2nd deltas. So you 
#    will see each frame totally has 39 dims. 
#    Refer to Section 2.5 of this document http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224s/hw/openSMILE_manual.pdf for better configuration
#    (e.g., normalization) and other feature types (e.g., PLPs )

# You may find the number of MFCC files mfcc/*.mfcc.csv is slightly less than the number of the videos. This is because some of the videos
# don't hae the audio track. For example, HVC1221, HVC1222, HVC1261, HVC1794 

# In this part, we train a clustering model to cluster the MFCC vectors. In order to speed up the clustering process, we
# select a small portion of the MFCC vectors. In the following example, we only select 20% randomly from each video.
