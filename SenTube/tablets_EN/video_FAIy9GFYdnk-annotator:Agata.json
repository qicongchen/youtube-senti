Packing a 1.4 GHz dual-core Exynos processor, Galaxy Note comes to the table with a 5.3-inch Super AMOLED HD (800x1280) display, 8-megapixel camera with 1080p HD video recording, 2-megapixel front-facing camera, 2,500 mAh battery, and Android 2.3 with TouchWiz 4.0.  It's coming soon to AT&T (with 4G LTE connectivity), but you can buy the international version online right now.\n\nIt's a giant phone - that's for sure - but it offers some killer specs and a great battery.  How big is too big?
