{"category":"Tech","view_count":"163888","video_description":"A review of the Nook Tablet Android tablet and ebook reader from Barnes & Noble. Here is our super in-depth full written review: http:\/\/www.mobiletechreview.com\/ereaders\/Nook-Tablet.htm This is their second gen 7\" color LCD ereader and more. It runs Android OS 2.3 with B&N's Nook 1.4 firmware at launch. The UI looks much the same as the last gen Nook Color, but there's a much faster dual core 1GHz CPU inside and double the RAM so the tablet can run the included Netflix, Hulu Plus and Adobe Flash smoothly. It has an IPS display, 16 gigs of storage and a microUSB port.","title":"Nook Tablet Review","avg_rating":"4.7926564","video_id":"UEJLYaQzPvc","video_type":"review","comments":[{"text":"Nook > Kobo Vox > Amazon Fire\ufeff","published":"2011-11-16T22:02:47.000Z","id":"uB0uvpkRQvLYAaUHS90dPqYLsH6akbO4Snm6BpBrZsw","author":"JogBird","annotation":{"product-related":"1","positive-product":"1","rating":"2"}},{"text":"that was cool seeing the first episode\ufeff of parks and recreation when you played netflix","published":"2011-11-16T22:04:27.000Z","id":"uB0uvpkRQvK40tHwrdCRHSaDrBadUqztx98DiC60Upk","author":"aza091234","annotation":{"video-related":"1","positive-video":"1","vrating":"2"}},{"text":"or get both the nook tablet and kindle fire\ufeff and spend 50 bucks less than buying an ipad.","published":"2011-11-16T22:25:11.000Z","id":"uB0uvpkRQvK5aXpB63XLJhMG07uR9xtCgfOpRb1Dnwg","author":"chris quiles","annotation":{"product-related":"1","rating":"2"}},{"text":"This two devices (Nook and Fire) show how much overpriced is the Galaxy\ufeff Tab 7.0 plus","published":"2011-11-16T22:26:22.000Z","id":"uB0uvpkRQvIbRdIyveYdCESmjroOklp9Vma4VneEGrI","author":"GTRMclaren722","annotation":{"product-related":"1","rating":"2","positive-product":"1"}},{"text":"This seems a lot faster than\ufeff the Kindle to me.
