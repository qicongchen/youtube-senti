{"category":"Tech","view_count":"14097","video_description":"For the complete HTC Flyer review, go to http:\/\/www.infosyncworld.com\/reviews\/internet-tablets\/htc-flyer-review\/12048.html\n\nTablets are assaulting the market this year, and we happened to get our hands on yet another one. The HTC Flyer joins the ranks of the Motorola XOOM, T-Mobile G-Slate iPad 2, and Samsung Galaxy Tab. However, the Flyer is our favorite model yet, offering a few tasty features that cannot be found on any of its competition. Take the optical pen-based writing and drawing capabilities of the Flyer, which converts the tablet into a notepad, sketch book, or Polaroid picture that can be scribbled on. It also fulfills the multimedia hound's needs by offering HTC Watch for streaming the latest movies straight to the device and OnLive Cloud Gaming with titles like Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, NBA 2K11, and Lego Harry Potter. Although the tablet resided on the small side of life, it proved to have the most superior Android interface, courtesy of HTC Sense, and was the speediest and most solid tablet we've seen yet, next to the iPad. Let's take off with the HTC Flyer.","title":"HTC Flyer Review","avg_rating":"4.609756","video_id":"xN7VLcfq6K8","video_type":"review","comments":[{"text":"dam i wanna\ufeff get the playbook but idk now :\\","published":"2011-05-24T22:22:10.000Z","id":"2B_HtZTE--rqLefFJUt7F7_BmofWiMmlLtgXaOXs12k","author":"S69NER","annotation":{"product-related":"1","rating":"2"}},{"text":"Don't...\ufeff You'll probably be better off getting the Acer Iconia tablet.","published":"2011-05-24T22:33:04.000Z","id":"2B_HtZTE--pR_166S4EaQNuAF-W_qBYarDzQL4M80b8","author":"DeltaPhi79","annotation":{"product-related":"1","negative-product":"1","rating":"1"}},{"text":"Wow best\ufeff tablet out.
