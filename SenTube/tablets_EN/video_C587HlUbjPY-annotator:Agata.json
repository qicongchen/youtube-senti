Thanks for mentioning the acer ring for\ufeff web browser I very seldom use it, but I'll give it try for web browsing.  My two down points with it is that while it has a 32GB HDD; however half of it was used up w\/preinstalled stuff.  Next was weight.  I added a SD card to regain more storage.  Overall it suits my needs so I'm okay with it.
