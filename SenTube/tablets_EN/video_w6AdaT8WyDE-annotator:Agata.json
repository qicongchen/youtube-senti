Check out our full review at: http:\/\/www.mobiletechreview.com\/notebooks\/Asus-Eee-Slate.htm The Eee Slate runs Windows 7 Home Premium 64 bit on a ULV Intel Core i5 CPU. It has a 12.1\" AFFS display that's similar to IPS but has better outdoor viewing. The 12.1\" size hits the sweet spot for capacitive touch and the tablet has a Wacom digitizer for pen input and drawing\/painting. The Asus is a very powerful tablet that's designed for both content creation and consumption and is perfect for artists and those who need to use Windows apps on their tablet.","title":"Asus Eee Slate EP121 Review","avg_rating":"4.854862","video_id":"w6AdaT8WyDE","video_type":"review","comments":[{"text":"I bought one the first day it came out, but, it had a big fat hot pixel right in the centre of the screen.
