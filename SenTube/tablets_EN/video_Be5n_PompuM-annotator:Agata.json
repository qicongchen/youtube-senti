However you showed nothing about what it can do. You spent most\ufeff of the video complaining about the touch screen(which I agree does suck). You didn't show how it plays flash, or Skype. Would have been nice to see how some simple task would work. You talked about the Stylus but didn't show us how well it recognize handwriting. Archos should market this thing to compete with netbooks and not the iPad.
