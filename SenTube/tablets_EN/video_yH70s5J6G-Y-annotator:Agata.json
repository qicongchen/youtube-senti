When it comes to bang for buck it just can't be beaten. Of there are a few 'issues' such e.g. no Bluetooth and a pretty shabby battery life of around 3 hours at full tilt. Even so, for the price... nothing matches it.\n\nAt the very *least* you'll be trying out a 7\" format to be able to decide if the\ufeff screen is large enough for you to use (which I'd say it is) without shelling out hundreds of dollars for something that in the end you don't use!","published":"2011-07-19T06:42:30.000Z","id":"Ed9-b64ODCYkuFZF5XNbu49roCJfIzdHGDb-06nBMj8","author":"Chris Lewis","annotation":{"product-related":"1","positive-product":"1","negative-product":"1","rating":"3"}},{"text":"Today Tonight: Infomercials in prime\ufeff time.","published":"2011-07-20T08:46:01.000Z","id":"Ed9-b64ODCYzpEPe3H-ZAYy99ml957tkZH2XTh7j_Vg","author":"AoDIronMask","annotation":{"vrating":"0","off-topic-or-undecidable":"1"}},{"text":"c.kogan.com.au\/c\/5k-giveaway\/XiPzvC4c\/\n\nWin\ufeff Kogan Gift Vouchers!!!!!!!","published":"2011-07-22T12:31:22.000Z","id":"Ed9-b64ODCbXy8cMxLS0_P9ZDaU2sg996oDSXDc0Jbs","author":"Bhoemen Wood","annotation":{"spam":"1"}},{"text":"Will Kogan go onto the ASX\ufeff some day soon?","published":"2011-08-09T02:22:30.000Z","id":"Ed9-b64ODCbBnDP3mxNU7vaz2LyRgbV7GtjjySPdFSE","author":"bigbillyz","annotation":{"product-related":"1","rating":"2"}},{"text":"Does it allow skype video calls yet?
