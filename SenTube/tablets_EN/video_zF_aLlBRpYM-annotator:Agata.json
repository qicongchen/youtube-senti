Last month Verizon released two new Motorola tablets, both of which are the first to receive the \"DROID\" branding: the DROID XYBOARD 8.2 and DROID XYBOARD10.1. The first Motorola tablet that Verizon released which ran on the Android Honeycomb operating system was the XOOM, but it didn't go over well, as it did not initially ship with LTE built-in (and the LTE Upgrade was delayed for several months). But this time around, Motorola seems to have got their act together.\nFor more details, check out our web site: http:\/\/www.phonearena.com\/reviews\/Motorola-DROID-XYBOARD-10.1-Review_id2940","title":"Motorola DROID XYBOARD 10.1 Review","avg_rating":"3.9850745","video_id":"zF_aLlBRpYM","video_type":"review","comments":[{"text":"YAY I\ufeff AM looking at a shit rewiev =)","published":"2012-01-16T10:08:36.000Z","id":"VhhWMEcHFslmyEgvoH3G4iPkW11ZT7DmDDGHRWh8G_k","author":"Adriano48512","annotation":{"video-related":"1","negative-video":"1","vrating":"1"}},{"text":"This came out too late\ufeff","published":"2012-01-16T10:21:42.000Z","id":"VhhWMEcHFslmWaG0VFxKVKRCzVx7TBVr-GV_AnKykZw","author":"Prostreetcrazy","annotation":{"product-related":"1","negative-product":"1","rating":"2"}},{"text":"when\ufeff it coming out? and how much it cost","published":"2012-01-16T10:25:11.000Z","id":"VhhWMEcHFsk2wK5A88xirTjj7yhmCO9hPERAZl-I8Do","author":"emsudboskovic","annotation":{"product-related":"1","rating":"1"}},{"text":"ive tried both iPad2 and this.
