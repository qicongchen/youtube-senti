I bought one refurbished off amazon and it was even cheaper than a kindle fire. Great buy for a decent tablet. We returned our vizio vtab to get this one. The camera is decent, 2mp front, 5mp back. Doesn't compare to my logitech\ufeff pro 9000 desktop webcam, but is all right for casual use. Microphone works nicely. This tablet also has support in the rooting community.","published":"2012-06-27T06:27:29.000Z","id":"_cMxtV0-kAwK0Gf8PG-4jgFOI-vF5EzIzgcw0Qb6S6E","author":"xMyztx","annotation":{"product-related":"1","positive-product":"1","negative-product":"1","rating":"3"}},{"text":"My husband bought a 16GB version refurbished off amazon, and the\ufeff sim card slot was active (AT&T).","published":"2012-06-27T06:29:35.000Z","id":"_cMxtV0-kAxK85HXe82j708W65EjlDh7jbPY9E1u-y4","author":"xMyztx","annotation":{"product-related":"1","rating":"3"}},{"text":"Thanks for your answer.

I have seen so many $60-100 tablets out there all with terrible reviews and well this review you posted is enough for me to say I would buy one.
