Check out our full review at: http:\/\/www.mobiletechreview.com\/tablets\/Asus-Eee-Pad-Transformer.htm  The Transformer competes with the Motorola Xoom, Samung Galaxy Tab 10.1 and Acer Iconia Tab A500. It has the usual dual core 1GHz Tegra 2 CPU, a gig of RAM, 16 or 32 gigs of internal storage, a 9.5 hour battery, dual cameras, WiFi and Bluetooth with GPS. This is a WiFi-on tablet with a sharp 1280 x 800 IPS display. Asus sells a dock-keyboard combo that also adds a secondary battery and USB port for $149, hence the Transformer name.\n\nCheck out our video review of the Keyboard Dock for the Eee Pad Transformer: http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=4VLoGqsH3s4","title":"Asus Eee Pad Transformer Review","avg_rating":"4.7238936","video_id":"Y89p8SCNXlI","video_type":"review","comments":[{"text":"Im sold\ufeff","published":"2011-05-17T20:53:56.000Z","id":"4eS7p3IC0YRHUPAwIyhIIJo_GAJ7IqpExAmoU_NSr7Q","author":"T67GS300","annotation":{"off-topic-or-undecidable":"1"}},{"text":"Its been like a hour since its been uploaded and its still 240p \ufeff","published":"2011-05-17T21:14:04.000Z","id":"4eS7p3IC0YRokciIHvBIg3rjD6qW2mnDL-CDKoz9TK8","author":"T67GS300","annotation":{"video-related":"1","vrating":"2"}},{"text":"yesssssssssssss!  im so glad the best tech reviewer in\ufeff the world reviewed the best tablet in the world!","published":"2011-05-17T21:38:59.000Z","id":"4eS7p3IC0YSFSosUKPhFTIS79_dTxcLjpBu6PY5Sd3I","author":"PowerSprinter","annotation":{"product-related":"1","video-related":"1","positive-product":"1","positive-video":"1","rating":"1","vrating":"1"}},{"text":"where's\ufeff michael bay?","published":"2011-05-17T21:43:32.000Z","id":"4eS7p3IC0YTZb8OYBPdHtPNSEaS2Nf7g8JxWg3exCxw","author":"iiGerardoii","annotation":{"product-related":"1","rating":"1"}},{"text":"i love this tablet such a cost- effective\ufeff device","published":"2011-05-17T22:05:04.000Z","id":"4eS7p3IC0YR56I9WXdX9kLkasAR9c0WmY83YAEDqkQg","author":"Revanchist8525","annotation":{"product-related":"1","positive-product":"1","rating":"2"}},{"text":"Localized remote\ufeff desktop seems rather useless.","published":"2011-05-17T22:16:50.000Z","id":"4eS7p3IC0YRC5k-iQ2Uk-aDIhqfKRszXWoVy1OqVe8Y","author":"shihonage","annotation":{"product-related":"1","negative-product":"1","rating":"2"}},{"text":"Methinks the Mycloud app could be used to mirror the excellent Mobipocket Reader for Windows, therefore having something no other Android reader\ufeff has, so far, a multi-dictionary text-search feature, for those of us who would like to properly study languages with our tablets.\n\nThe Mycloud support seems quick to support text search\/highlighting without any major delay.
