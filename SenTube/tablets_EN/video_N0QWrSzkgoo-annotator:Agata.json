They offer very similar specs apart from their screen sizes and the fact that the 10.1 inch model comes equipped with a stylus and supports handwriting recognition.  Both feature dual-core 1.2GHz processor with 1GB of RAM and feature 16 or 32GB of internal storage (a 64GB 10.1 model is also available).  They go on sale starting on December 20.
