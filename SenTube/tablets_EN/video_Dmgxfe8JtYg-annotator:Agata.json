{"category":"Tech","view_count":"173090","video_description":"ASUS Transformer Prime Review - http:\/\/www.netbooknews.com The Transformer Prime has a 10.1\u2033 Super IPS+ 1280 x 800, 10 finger multitouch display with Corning's Gorilla Glass. Under the hood we've got Nvidia's new Tegra 3 quad core processor with 1GB or RAM and the option for a 32 or 64GB SSD along side some cloud based storage from ASUS Webstorage.\n\nThe camera is significantly improved with an 8MP rear facing camera and a 1.2MP on the front with increased shutted speeds. The rear camera has a flash and features a large F2.4 aperture when most others have a smaller F2.8 which will improve field of depth. There are a bevy of connections available including a 2-in-1 audio jack, micro HDMI, Micro SD card reader, internal microphone and the dock offers an additional 1 USB 2.0 & a full size card reader. There are also a series of sensors including a G-Sensor, Gyroscope, E-compass, GPS & Light Sensor which presumably will be used to automatically gauge screen brightness.  It also comes in two colours.  We haven't been able to get our hands on the Champagne Gold, but we are told that its the more elegant of the two...which is hard to believe since the Grey was pretty stunning.","title":"ASUS Transformer Prime Review - TF201 with Docking Station","avg_rating":"3.7627907","video_id":"Dmgxfe8JtYg","video_type":"review","comments":[{"text":"epic device :D apple sucks...\ufeff","published":"2011-12-01T13:35:12.000Z","id":"TMwhCZQvaDpRdmKXmfkqdM8OzbddY8vcpWqBGzL-Tvg","author":"wssroach","annotation":{"product-related":"1","positive-product":"1","rating":"1"}},{"text":"Dear\ufeff Santa, ...","published":"2011-12-01T14:10:05.000Z","id":"TMwhCZQvaDpkniEII8c8xaOxkgZ3h6YVpYAAZum3PSs","author":"Osama Obama","annotation":{"off-topic-or-undecidable":"1"}},{"text":"the mini port is\ufeff Mini HDMI","published":"2011-12-01T16:11:29.000Z","id":"TMwhCZQvaDo_NmkpJuuB_JRB9hdJkGy1IhkpptNqgKE","author":"cheeyc","annotation":{"product-related":"1","rating":"2"}},{"text":"does the dock battery\ufeff still drain when it's attached to the tablet in sleep mode?","published":"2011-12-01T17:43:06.000Z","id":"TMwhCZQvaDpFN42oUryVykbirbyAFenMkOb8DRmxd2s","author":"Apotheosis605","annotation":{"product-related":"1","negative-product":"1","rating":"2"}},{"text":"No,\ufeff it's Micro HDMI (the old TF101 had a Mini HDMI) ;)","published":"2011-12-01T19:26:20.000Z","id":"TMwhCZQvaDrnq4vij7VrAPP4Txw_-buHeasw9s8avZM","author":"oliverblaser","annotation":{"product-related":"1","rating":"2"}},{"text":"sorry, but being an hybrid between a tab\ufeff and a netbook is simply a joke. at that price...you buy an ipad PLUS a netbook.\nandroid can't work as a serious OS as mac os or win. simply there's game over, a netbook will be a netbook, and a tab a tab..for now.\nas a tab..yes, it's slightly better than other androids....and against ipad it's got flash plugin, usb and SD...but it's worth use apps that are not specifically programmed on the item you use? and a poor shop","published":"2011-12-01T20:03:21.000Z","id":"TMwhCZQvaDqVigrdvA8uISk3oj93I-iwnPC1pmw2fk8","author":"sniperfranky","annotation":{"product-related":"1","positive-product":"1","negative-product":"1","rating":"3"}},{"text":"yeah you can't work with android, for now!
