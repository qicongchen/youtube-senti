{"category":"Tech","view_count":"7381","video_description":"A review of the Acer Iconia Tab A500. Overall, it's a very nice tablet with a great range of connectivity options including host USB, and mini HDMI. Android Honeycomb 3.0 comes by default, but and update to 3.2 is available. Battery life is admirable, and build quality is surprisingly good, if a bit weightier than the iPad 2 and Mototrola Xoom. \n\nDefinitely recommended for its relatively low price point, and it's a worthy netbook replacement if you don't need too much storage.\n\nMore Android and Linux vids on the way!","title":"ACER ICONIA TAB A500 REVIEW | IGO | DEC 5","avg_rating":"4.133758","video_id":"W3NlpNBgeJ0","video_type":"review","comments":[{"text":"What operating system are you running on\ufeff the laptop behind you? the one with the polar bear","published":"2011-12-05T08:50:31.000Z","id":"y6XRXoU6Gycr7OMXnDdA3M7jOYMgWI-0fS8ZdPjrqFc","author":"TheTechBite","annotation":{"vrating":"1","video-related":"1"}},{"text":"Great\ufeff Review - Thanks.","published":"2011-12-05T10:01:10.000Z","id":"y6XRXoU6Gyf-H-Gj2rkLqstgg7t1Nf5v0TQ2Og2byXY","author":"OmenX13","annotation":{"video-related":"1","positive-video":"1","vrating":"1"}},{"text":"good review.\nYes, do more android\ufeff stuff please","published":"2011-12-05T10:36:46.000Z","id":"y6XRXoU6GyefiGknhGLTZD5rWCx7nxHgSUUsM5qD4j4","author":"Matthew Ives","annotation":{"video-related":"1","positive-video":"1","vrating":"2"}},{"text":"Nice Review...well done.\nLove to see more Android and Tablet stuff. \ufeff Cheers..","published":"2011-12-05T11:02:07.000Z","id":"y6XRXoU6GyeSX2cBaeE9exoG6b8SPs3xc3Ls5f5YU20","author":"Slushpuppie55","annotation":{"video-related":"1","positive-video":"1","vrating":"2"}},{"text":"I'm planning to buy a tablet soon.
