{"category":"Tech","view_count":"67964","video_description":"Motorola Xoom Unboxing & 1st Look\n\nEver since the world met the Motorola Xoom at CES  (Consumer Electronics Show) last month in Las Vegas, people have been buzzing about how it might finally be the tablet to take on the iPad.  It was hard to deny that Android Honeycomb  looked spectacular on it, and it certainly got people to talking about it all through out the show.  Some of that luster has worn off, however, as details emerged about the pricing and the fact that it won't have Flash support for some time yet.\n\nAll that aside, the device has finally launched, and it's time we get a real world look at the first tablet to not only run Honeycomb, but also to use the NVIDIA dual-core Tegra II processor.  How's it going to look once you get it out of the box?  How does it compare to the iPad for size and weight?  Check out the video above to discover all those answers and more about the new Motorola Xoom tablet.\n\nWhat do you think?  Is the Motorola Xoom a worthy competitor to the iPad?","title":"Motorola Xoom Unboxing","avg_rating":"4.6007395","video_id":"VaKyI5hz1Vk","video_type":"review","comments":[{"text":"titties\ufeff","published":"2011-02-25T03:22:21.000Z","id":"10Rjt3OAdgwGTvx2BGqgod_xPalBgvhM5pEXRbtrpD8","author":"RecklessVlogger","annotation":{"off-topic-or-undecidable":"1"}},{"text":"first\ufeff","published":"2011-02-25T03:22:25.000Z","id":"10Rjt3OAdgy_07qhcHZw9UV_PS1wvuIbwrcnu0EjkxM","author":"iLoveTouch10","annotation":{"off-topic-or-undecidable":"1"}},{"text":"TITS!\ufeff","published":"2011-02-25T03:22:45.000Z","id":"10Rjt3OAdgyAPgGeuC1dfxe7w65Yl2EbNbnNv5GGOpU","author":"1337wApz0r","annotation":{"off-topic-or-undecidable":"1"}},{"text":"last\ufeff","published":"2011-02-25T03:22:45.000Z","id":"10Rjt3OAdgyAPgGeuC1df9otV0fd5ecJA-Zq5ib_cGY","author":"iLoveTouch10","annotation":{"off-topic-or-undecidable":"1"}},{"text":"first\ufeff ...ah who cares","published":"2011-02-25T03:22:46.000Z","id":"10Rjt3OAdgxaTVzIQimsJjPq8QpctLJhmmHHN8veWeI","author":"alfredo rodriguez","annotation":{"off-topic-or-undecidable":"1"}},{"text":"No. You fail.\ufeff","published":"2011-02-25T03:22:57.000Z","id":"10Rjt3OAdgzQtqtmwPrgaRSQ2kZQar-mKvYmximJA74","author":"T67GS300","annotation":{"off-topic-or-undecidable":"1"}},{"text":"tits indeed\ufeff","published":"2011-02-25T03:23:05.000Z","id":"10Rjt3OAdgy59-fYynB_Jq3zZZviYbRckK1nDL_3Dp4","author":"jeff9559","annotation":{"off-topic-or-undecidable":"1"}},{"text":"JEWISH\ufeff","published":"2011-02-25T03:23:11.000Z","id":"10Rjt3OAdgz6Bg6pJelrYe0jRIVc8IpOZZBGlt24xww","author":"ushipp","annotation":{"off-topic-or-undecidable":"1"}},{"text":"9sdfxcvm  water\ufeff poo soup gross!!!1","published":"2011-02-25T03:23:25.000Z","id":"10Rjt3OAdgwiNuxgrEPDg34eBuSzBYICkLyhhgJFY1c","author":"sjsharksfan454","annotation":{"off-topic-or-undecidable":"1"}},{"text":"10th\ufeff","published":"2011-02-25T03:23:28.000Z","id":"10Rjt3OAdgxeeqbuwTp2keLM26A56J4f3yzAzBBadHU","author":"ModernWarfareTDM","annotation":{"off-topic-or-undecidable":"1"}},{"text":"CHICKEN!\ufeff","published":"2011-02-25T03:24:43.000Z","id":"10Rjt3OAdgyXvjm1E9aPDe4xIygr-ez-zTZx1MKkuh4","author":"PlayNChilllStudio","annotation":{"off-topic-or-undecidable":"1"}},{"text":"Not\ufeff first","published":"2011-02-25T03:25:00.000Z","id":"10Rjt3OAdgwpvI4kkXs5X8lfGTxQIxOspJHG0ClL70c","author":"SuperLeonification","annotation":{"off-topic-or-undecidable":"1"}},{"text":"tablets are\ufeff going to make netbooks obsolete","published":"2011-02-25T03:25:17.000Z","id":"10Rjt3OAdgwj9uWkZfytmPZNFooTomCXAukbimpOU7E","author":"nintendoatarikiller","annotation":{"product-related":"1","rating":"2"}},{"text":"every one below this line, blow me\n________\ufeff","published":"2011-02-25T03:25:34.000Z","id":"10Rjt3OAdgzuBoMz4Y68Foq-o85qMjZsofs_hAPAhto","author":"Luke Enderle","annotation":{"off-topic-or-undecidable":"1"}},{"text":"@famouswolfy truuueeeeeeeeeeeeeee\ufeff","published":"2011-02-25T03:25:50.000Z","id":"10Rjt3OAdgzxDStWoCncI9Cz7LIG03kElCLcYe1o38A","author":"SCRUFFBET","annotation":{"off-topic-or-undecidable":"1"}},{"text":"hmm lemme see...mac for\ufeff $600 or for a shitty motorolla tablet for $800....do I have to answer?","published":"2011-02-25T03:26:45.000Z","id":"10Rjt3OAdgwRV20eU_AvL8z44xmkfcMlocslXfVrhtI","author":"EzarikX","annotation":{"product-related":"1","negative-product":"1","rating":"2"}},{"text":"is\ufeff it possible to use it in the vertical position?","published":"2011-02-25T03:28:10.000Z","id":"10Rjt3OAdgwAE_35s1rJiopJMyvd66FOgqYVxVEUB7U","author":"davidiscrazzy","annotation":{"product-related":"1","rating":"1"}},{"text":"I think I'll wait a few years, when I would actually have a use for a tablet.
